=== Detailed Description
This handler uses the Exchange Web Services (accessed through the Viewpoint ruby
gem) to delete an existing appointment. After configuring the API to connect
to the server, the appointment will be created and the handler will return an
id that can be used to access the newly created appointment at a later time. 
Any errors encountered will be caught and re-raised by the handler.
