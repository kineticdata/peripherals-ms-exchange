The following modifications were made to the vendor libraries in order to make
them compatible with the Kinetic Task process:

Viewpoint
 * Added the version file to the Viewpoint gem at lib/viewpoint/version.rb
 * Automatically adding the SOAP prefix in lib/ews/soap/builders/ews_builder.rb
 starting on line 49 because the java version of nokogiri wasn't adding it automatically
 * Added an Array type to /lib/ews/types/calendar_item.rb at lines 80-85
    NOTE: If you are passing an Array, you will need to use the build_xml 
    structure when structuring your arrays.
    ie. If you are passing text, {:name => {:text => "First Name"}}
    If you are passing nested elements {:attendee => {:sub_elements => [{:name => {:text => "First Name"}}]}}
 * Changed /lib/ews/types/calendar_item.rb at line 32 to use the passed in 
 :send_meeting_invitations value if it is present

 * Commented out line 154 in /lib/ews/types/item_field_uri_map.rb
   'recurrence' is replicated from line 121.
   121 is the calendar recurrence; 154 is task recurrence
   This only affected our update process for recurring calendar events, but would most likely affect task recurrences

 * Updated lib/web/soap/builders/ews_builder.rb
 	Commented out line 1248-1249 and added line 1250.  The actual occurrence_item_id! handles the item variable
 		1248:  #occurrence_item_id!(
        1249:  #  item[:recurring_master_id], item[:change_key], item[:instance_index])
        1250:  occurrence_item_id!(item) 

     Commented out line 1248-1249 and added line 1250.  The actual recurring_master_item_id! handles the item variable
 		1252:  #recurring_master_item_id!(item[:occurrence_id], item[:change_key])
        1253:  recurring_master_item_id!(item)
