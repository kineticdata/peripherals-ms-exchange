=== Detailed Description
This handler uses the Exchange Web Services Java API to return all Exchange
appointments within a given time range. After configuring the API to connect
to the server and getting the correct time frame, an API call is made which
returns an Array of appointment objects. This Array is then iterated over to
make a JSON table with all of the relevant appointment data. Each appointment
has a hash that contains the subject, location, start and end time, as well as
the organizer and both the required and optional attendees. Any errors 
encountered will be caught and re-raised by the handler.
