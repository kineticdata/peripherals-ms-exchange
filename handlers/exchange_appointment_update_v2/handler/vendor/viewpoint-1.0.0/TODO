h2. TODOS

* Automate "deepening" of Model objects by over-riding method_missing

<pre>
if object.is_shallow? && all_methods.index(method)
  deepen!
else
  raise the NoMethod error
</pre>

* Clean-up exceptions.  There is exception raising in the Model that will never ocurr because it is already being checked for in the Parser

* Refactor #find_folders methods.  There is a lot of duplicate code right now and it could be simplified quite a bit.

* Test TODO
** Test for undefined methods and make sure the method_missing method isn't causing problems
