=== Detailed Description
This handler uses the Exchange Web Services (accessed through the Viewpoint ruby
gem) to delete an existing appointment. After configuring the API to connect
to the server the appointment corresponding to the inputted id is retrieved. 
If it is successfully found, the appointment will use the inputted item 
information to create an update object, which will then be sent to Exchange to
update the item. Any errors encountered will be caught and re-raised by the 
handler.

Note: For every field except Required and Optional Attendees, if you don't pass
any values the original values will remain the same. For Required and Optional
Attendees, if you don't pass any values all the people who were invited in the
original appointment will be uninvited.
