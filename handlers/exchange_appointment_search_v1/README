=== Detailed Description
This handler uses the Exchange Web Services (accessed through the Viewpoint ruby
gem) to search for existing appointments. After configuring the API to connect
to the server the api starts by searching for all events between the Start and
End date. If a Subject was also passed as a parameter, the results of the first
search will be iterated through to see if the inputted subject is contained in
any of the returned items subject line. All of the items that match both 
conditions are then finally returned in JSON format. Any errors encountered
will be caught and re-raised by the handler.
